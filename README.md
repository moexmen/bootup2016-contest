# Boot Up! 2016 Contest Submissions

## Contest Format

Separate contests for 2D and 3D runes were held.

Schools with larger groups of students were divided into groups of about 10.
Each group could submit 2 of each rune type.

Teachers carried out preliminary voting among their student groups
to determine which 2 runes would enter the finals.

A Coursemology survey was then created for students to vote for the top winners.

## Repository Contents

This repository holds all the valid student submissions, arranged in subfolders
by school and rune type.

Submissions of Python source code were ignored.
